## Introduction

This project analyzes energy consumption data from the Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO) to identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights for promoting sustainable energy practices. The analysis covers eight years from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2023.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze historical energy consumption data to identify long-term trends and patterns.
2. To develop predictive models to forecast future energy consumption.
3. To provide insights for proactive planning and decision-making.
4. To promote sustainable energy practices based on data-driven insights.

## Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders for this project include:
- Government and regulatory bodies for policy development and resource planning.
- Energy providers to influence consumer behavior and implement energy efficiency programs.
- The general public for ensuring reliable power supply and promoting sustainability.

## Data

The dataset is sourced from the AESO public data portal and covers the period from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2023. It includes:
- Energy generation data
- Energy demand/load data

The data was cleaned and preprocessed using Power BI and Python.

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis

We performed exploratory data analysis to visualize and understand the data:
- Histograms to visualize the distribution of energy load.
- Box plots and violin plots to analyze load distribution by region and season.
- Summary statistics to understand data spread.

### Predictive Modeling

We developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms:
- Time-series forecasting models such as SARIMAX to predict future energy generation and demand.

### Load Forecasting

Load forecasting was conducted to optimize resource allocation and ensure reliable power supply. 

## Results

Key findings from the analysis include:
- Noticeable trends and seasonality in energy consumption, with peaks during winter.
- A significant decline in coal-powered energy generation, indicating a shift to cleaner energy sources.
- Predictive models indicate stable consumption patterns with increased demand expected due to population growth and industrial activities.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend:
1. Increasing investment in renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and natural gas.
2. Establishing more energy storage facilities to balance supply and demand.
3. Continuous engagement with regulatory bodies to align energy policies with sustainability goals.

## Risk and Reward Analysis

### Risks
1. **Market Volatility**: High volatility due to natural disasters, economic conditions, and geopolitical events.
2. **Regulatory Changes**: Impact of changing policies on investment and operations.
3. **Technological Advancements**: Disruptive effects of rapid technological changes.
4. **Environmental Push**: Stringent regulations affecting traditional energy sources.

### Rewards
1. **Innovation Opportunities**: Growth opportunities in clean energy technologies.
2. **Increased Demand**: Higher energy demand due to population growth and industrialization.
3. **Energy Transition**: Investment opportunities in renewable energy projects.

## Conclusion

The project highlights the importance of transitioning to renewable energy sources and improving energy storage solutions to ensure a sustainable and reliable energy supply in Alberta. Data-driven insights are crucial for shaping sustainable energy practices and meeting future energy demands.
